# worldbuilding-machine-analysis

## Description
This project contains a data pipeline that draws unformatted JSON objects from the MediaWiki API and formats them into a number of CSV and Excel files. These files will be used to create a Tableau dashboard.

## Historical Context
For the better part of the last eight or so years I have been participating in writing and setting-building for personal entertainment reasons. A month ago, as part of an application for a position with The Data School, I decided to investigate the growth and development of a writing project that formed from this hobby over the last two years. The pipeline in this repository produced the files in the datasets folder that went into a Tableau dashboard that formed part of the submission to the position in question.
