# worldbuilding-machine-analysis

## Description
For the better part of the last seven years I have put some of my free time towards this worldbuilding project that I started on an Internet forum board and continued until the current day (as of 27 November 2024). The last time I checked a couple of weeks ago I have a minimum of 400,000 words written down (and much more text that has been retconned and deleted throughout the process).

Note that the code here is not capable of running on their own without some hidden files. I will release the hidden files in question when I feel the time is right.
