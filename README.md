# worldbuilding-machine-analysis

## Description
For the better part of the last seven years I have put some of my free time towards this worldbuilding project that I started on an Internet forum board and continued until the current day (as of 27 November 2024). I have not kept track of how much I wrote, but I estimate that I have around 100,000 words of presentable content (and much more text that has been retconned and deleted throughout the process).
